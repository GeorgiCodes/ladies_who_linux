Now over 20 year old, the Linux kernel might be one of the most significant pieces of open source software ever developed. 

Linux is everywhere: in fact it powers more than half the servers on the internet as well as our our TVs and Android smartphones.

These images here are all pictures of different types of linux operating system distributions and at the heart of every one of them is the Linux Kernel.

Today the Linux Kernel has been contributed to by over 8000 developers and by 800 companies. Its comprised of over 15 million lines of code. Its updated by 10 patches a day, 7 days a week a new release come out every 2-3 months. This is much faster turn around than say Windows where new versions are only released every couple of years. 

## History

So where did this all begin?

In 1991 Linus Torvalds was a student in Finland, and he started a project to build his own operating system kernel. Linus also collected together other essential ingredients required to construct an entire operating system with his kernel at the center. 

His project started to get noticed and soon became known as Linux. A year later he released the kernel under the General Public License, GPL which made it possible to build a worldwide community of developers. 

By combining the linux kernel with other system components, numerous other developers created complete systems called Linux Distributions in about the mid-90â€™s.

## Linux distributions
TODO image

At mentioned before at the heart of every distribution is the Linux Kernel. A full Linux distribution consists of a kernel plus other programs such as graphical desktops, software package management and user management. 

TODO
* talk about how some distros are suitable for IoT etc.
* Talk about distributed kernel in CoreOS
